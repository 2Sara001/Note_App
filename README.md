# Idea 
There is no doubt that note-taking applications are one of the basic applications we need on our smartphones to help us save and record important ideas and appointments or some quick information or voice notes, etc., and then access them in an easy way when we need them, so we are going to program a note-taking application with a beautiful design. 
# Works 
At first, when the user runs the app, the application will start with splash screen as shown in figure 1, you can enter the application in two ways, first is click on (Get Started) button which is shown at the bottom. Or you can make it automatically run into the next activity after 5 seconds, it will be awesome. 
 The next screen is home screen, this is how the screen looks when there is no note. You can start adding your notes through the add button located at the bottom right of the screen.
